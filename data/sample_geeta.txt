Chapter 2, Verse 47:
You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.

Chapter 2, Verse 20:
The soul is neither born, nor does it ever die; nor having once existed, does it ever cease to be. The soul is without birth, eternal, immortal, and ageless. It is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.

Chapter 6, Verse 5:
One must deliver himself with the help of his mind, and not degrade himself. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.

Isha Upanishad, Verse 1:
All this—whatever exists in this changing universe—is enveloped by the Lord. Therefore, find your enjoyment in renunciation; do not covet what belongs to others.
